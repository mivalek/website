preamble:
    Welcome to the third and final part of a mini-series about creating the [interactive visualisation of bouldering data](/portfolio/boulder-viz/) shown on the main page of this website.

    In the {{< link "first part" "blog/01_boulder_viz_pt1/index.md" >}}, I showed how to use Python to scrape some of the data the visualisation is based on from the web. If you haven't read it, I would encourage you to do that before reading on.

    The {{< link "second part" "blog/02_boulder_viz_pt2/index.md" >}} dealt with processing the scraped data using R to get them in a shape that's suitable for building the visualisation.

    In this part, I will show how I built the viz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
