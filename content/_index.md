## Hello, I'm Milan!

As the borderline pretentious title of my website suggests, I like making pretty things:
Pretty models, pretty visualisations, pretty teaching materials and websites, taking pretty photos, doing pretty climbs, going on pretty bike rides...

Actually, I kind of think that whatever we believe in or pursue ultimately boils down to what we find &aelig;sthetically pleasing. You can tell I'm not a philosopher.
